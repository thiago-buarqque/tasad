# Optimization
- [ ] Process training / test images, save them and then use the processed during training. This will probably reduce training time by ~10%.

# General approach
- [ ] Validate the model after every epoch;
- [ ] Add early stopping. The authors trained for 4000 epochs, it seems too much;
- [ ] Evaluate model prediction time after training

# Method

- [ ] **What am I going to propose to improve their method? **

# Results
