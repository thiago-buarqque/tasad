# Optimization
- [x] Validate the model after every epoch;
- [ ] Add early stopping. The authors trained for 4000 epochs, it seems too much;
- [ ] Evaluate model prediction time after training
- [ ] Do not generate anomalies on the background part of images

# Method

- [ ] **What am I going to propose to improve their method? **
