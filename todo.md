# Optimization

- [x] Validate the model after every epoch;
- [ ] Add early stopping. The authors trained for 4000 epochs, it seems too much;
- [ ] Evaluate model prediction time after training
- [ ] Save best models and checkpoint

# Method

- [ ] Do not generate anomalies on the background part of images

# Results

- [ ] How did my proposal improve their method?
- [ ] Compare code performance
